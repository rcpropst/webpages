	<p>My name is Ryan Propst and I am a <strong>2026</strong> graduate who plans to be an engineer after 4 years.
	I chose this major because of the beneifts that come with it like stability in wealth and healping 
	those in need. I also enjoy chrimnology and that is my back up plan if <ins>engineering</ins> does not work out.
	My dad is a <em>forensic</em> scientist and I have always found that interesting.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p> I have been an umpire for around three years now and I love it.
	This was my first and only job and I would not have it any other way.
	I dream about being an mechanical engineer to improve transportation.
	I want to create safer and more eco-friendly ways to travel.
	</p>
